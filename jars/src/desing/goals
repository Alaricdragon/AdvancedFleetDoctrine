interfaces:
    1) a json file that mods can have, adding new 'Advanced Fleet Doctrines' to there own factions
    2) a in game interface for adding fleet doctrines.
        -will require a button to output fleet doctrine as a json file
        -will require a button to output all ship layouts used in the fleet as variant files
    3) a in game interface for creating ship layouts for use in said doctrine
        -will require a button to output ship layout as a variant file

features:
    1) the ability to completely change the ships produced on a fleet by fleet basis. this includes:
        1) the ability to create new ships and loudouts.
        2) the ability to set different fleet groups, or different ships, to have different officer quality, ship quality, and ship numbers
        3) the ability to have different 'fleet groups' spawn in diffrent conditions.

    2) advanced fleet doctrines prebuilt for all the main core world factions
        -note: for 'unbound' factions (like the remaments, or dialect) its important to keep in mind that they cant use normal conditions. add a 'random' condition to allow for such to spawn.

    3) the option to turn make all ships cost 'credits', as apposed to whatever they cost now. (making more expensive ships take up more 'room' in the budget for there fleets)
    4) the option to turn on 'fleet size by DP' for hostile fleets
        -NOTE: for 3 and 4, its very important they remain OFF by default. Otherwise players will be angry. maybe?
