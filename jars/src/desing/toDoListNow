so first of all, im going to need to go down my list of requirements and learn things.
like how on earth the fleet doctrine works.

so to do list now:
    1) build up a system to calculate 'condition' and 'results' in a given ADF
        -like, the framework that will be built off of i mean.
    2) so what exsactly do I require to do...?
        -I want some type of master list for possible modifications to give a faction, that then:
            1) determins if its OK to change this fleet.
                -what fleets are ok to change:
                    all patrol fleets.
                    all trade fleets.
                    all private raiders.
                    all rearmament ordors.
                    all invasion fleets
                    all defense fleets.
                    all raid fleets.
                    all colony crises fleets.
                    all salvage fleets.
                    all mining fleets
                    all survey fleets.
                -what fleets are not ok to change
                    -quest fleets (from special bounty's for example)
                    -star lord fleets.
                    -specal task groups.
                    -detachments (industrial evolution)
            2) determins if any of the fleet docterins I have available fit this fleet.
            3) is 1 and 2 are true, change this fleet based on that fleet docterin.

            4) I also need to make sure it creates a fleet of a simler type to what was changed.
                -for example: a trade fleet would not be full of Hyperion's?????? (why would it be for gods sakes???)
            5) I need to make it so both conditions, and changes can read jsonObjects (for options).
        -I want a json file that can be used for the combined advanced fleet doctering
            -how do I even structure this?
            -well I think:
            {
                "factionID":{
                    "FleetDoctrinID":{ #this is just something you need named uneak to yourself. that's all. I sware..

questions:
hey everyone, its me here. im confused again, so please answer my questions if you want to.
1) when using a 'DefaultFleetInflater' to change what ships are in a fleet, i notice that it only takes effect after i mouse over a fleet. is there a way to change a fleets composition before i mouse over it?
2) are there any functions that randomly apply S-Mods / D-Mods to a ship?
3) are there any functions that give a ship random weapons / fighters? (like what happens to player faction ships when you have no weapons prioritized / fighters)? all i can do right now is directly spawn in a variant, and i want to do more.
thanks again for answering my questions the past few years everyone.
